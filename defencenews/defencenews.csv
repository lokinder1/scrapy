,"<p>The Defence Ministry is shortly expected to release project-specific implementation guidelines for the 111 naval utility helicopters to be procured under the Strategic Partnership (SP) model. However, foreign companies say there is still some clarity required on crucial legal, liability and technology transfer issues.<br><br>“There are two important issues that need clarity. One is legal. We can’t sell a submarine or fighter jet to a private company. Global regulations do not allow that. It has to be to a government-owned company. So, there has to be a government-to-government component in the end,” a top executive of a foreign company said.<br><br><br>Large infrastructure ::<br><br>For the first time, under the SP model, Indian private companies will get to tie up with global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and build major defence platforms in India under technology transfer. So far, it was defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs) which played the lead role.<br><br>The other issue, he said, was about the liability of the end product. “For us to stand guarantee to the finished product built by a local company is a problem. There has to be a back-end mechanism to enable us,” he said.<br><br>This liability issue was one of the major reasons the earlier medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA) deal for 126 jets got derailed at the contract negotiation stage, after Dassault Aviation refused to stand guarantee to the aircraft manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL).<br><br>Another senior executive observed that there is large infrastructure already present in the country with DPSUs and this must be utilised for the benefit of both the country as well as form a business sense.<br><br>“We hope to try and use that. There is no point reinventing everything. It will be risk mitigating for everyone,” he said.<br><br>There is need for some clarity from the MoD on production transfer and technology transfer as well, the executive added.<br><br>In July-end, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) cleared the general as well as project-specific implementation guidelines for the naval helicopters that would lay emphasis on transfer of technology and high absorption of indigenous content. The guidelines and the qualification guidelines are yet to be communicated to the industry.<br><br>All procurements under the SP model would be executed by specially constituted empowered project committees (EPC) to ensure timely execution, the Ministry said. Apart from the helicopters, the projects to be processed under the SP model are fighter aircraft, P-75I submarines and armoured vehicles.</p>",New 111 Naval Utility Helicopters will enable technology transfer
,"<p>The third indigenously designed and built offshore patrol vessel (OPV) for the Coast Guard was formally launched near here today. <br><br>To be inducted after extensive trials, the OPV will be manned by a 102-member crew and utilised for day and night patrol, surveillance and to provide coastal security, a cost guard release said. <br><br>The vessel ""YARD-45003"" equipped with ultra-modern navigation and communication systems is the third in the series of the seven being built by the Larsen and Toubro Shipbuilding under a contract it had signed with the Ministry of Defence in March 2015. <br><br>The first and second vessel were launched in October 2017 and January this year respectively. <br><br>At a function held in the presence of Coast Guard Additional Director General K R Nautiya at the Kattupalli Shipyard, the third OPV was formally lowered into the waters of Bay of Bengal, the release said. <br><br>After completion of extensive trials, the vessel would be inducted into the Coast Guard by March next, it said. <br><br>The vessel measuring 98 metres in length and 14.8 metres in breadth has a gross tonnage of 2,100 tonnes and can reach a maximum speed of 26 knots per hour. <br><br>The ship is fitted with two diesel engines, 30-mm automatic gun and two 12.7-mm guns with fire control systems besides a twin-engine helicopter that would enhance its operational, surveillance capability, the release said. </p>",Third patrol vessel for Coast Guard launched before schedule by LnT
,"<p>A large number of heavily-armed terrorists are waiting across the Line of Control and the International Border for an opportunity to sneak into the state, Jammu and Kashmir police chief S P Vaid said today. The state director general of police, however, added that the Army and the Border Security Force personnel are keeping a tight vigil on the borders and have been largely successful to scuttle their attempts to infiltrate into the state.<br><br>Vaid also said a big campaign was underway on social media from Pakistan to trick youths into militancy on the basis of false propaganda but the police have taken effective measures to counter it and have managed to block many such accounts.<br><br>Talking to media persons after attestation-cum-passing out parade of 215 recruits at the Police Technical Training Institute here, Vaid said the intelligence reports suggest a huge presence of heavily-armed terrorists on launching pads across the LoC and the IB, awaiting an opportunity to sneak into the state.<br><br>“Our BSF and Army personnel, however, are fully alert to the challenge and it is because of their efforts that the terrorists are unable to succeed in their designs,” he said. He said the terrorists’ attempts are being successfully foiled by the security forces but “sometimes some of them do manage to infiltrate”.<br><br>Addressing the recruits earlier after inspecting the parade and taking salute at the march past, Vaid said, “Our neighbouring country has launched a major campaign on social media to lure youths into terrorism and violence through wrong information.”<br><br>“We have taken measures to cover it and, accordingly, media cells have been created at the range, district and zonal levels. We have opened 26 Facebook pages at district level, 189 at police station and zonal levels and 31 twitter handles and have occupied the social media space to counter the malicious campaign,” the DGP said. He said many accounts feeding wrong information to mislead the youths have been successfully blocked.<br><br>Asked about the reports of local militants giving up violence, he said, “It is good that the local boys are giving up the path of terrorism and returning to mainstream on appeals of their families. They are saving not only themselves and their families but are also saving the people of Kashmir from terrorism”.<br><br>“Some agencies and groups are misusing the social media to mislead the youths,” he said.<br><br>Vaid said the police also countered the rumours about Article 35A through social media yesterday which helped in stopping the agitation.<br><br>The protests and clashes rocked different parts of the Kashmir valley recently after rumours spread that the Supreme  Court has scrapped the Article 35A of the Constitution which guarantees special privileges and rights to the people of the state.<br><br>On the separatists’ call for a two-day strike in support of the Article 35A on August 30 and 31, he said, “We will deal with it effectively as we have been doing.”<br><br>The separatists and civil societies have launched a drive to retain the constitutional provision, the validity of which has been challenged in the Supreme court by an NGO.<br><br>On the sudden spurt of attacks on policemen, Vaid said various steps have been taken to ensure safety of the policemen during their visits to their families. “Last time when Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh visited the state and met the police personnel at Anantnag police lines (in south Kashmir), we made a request to him to sanction residential quarters for the cops and he asked us to submit a proposal,” he said.<br><br>The DGP said the proposal has been submitted to the Union Home Ministry through the state government for construction of 5000 quarters for policemen. “It is under consideration of the government and we are hopeful that it will be sanctioned,” he added.<br><br>On the sanction of two battalions to help people living within 10 kms of the LoC and the IB, Vaid said the state government has given its approval and a board was being set up for making recruitment shortly.<br><br>Vaid said the police are also formulating a scheme for the special police officers (SPO) who have served the force for the last two decades. “We have taken up the matter with the government and I am hopeful of a positive response”.</p>",Large number of terrorists waiting at border to sneak into J-K: Police chief
,"<p>While the US is openly wooing India, there are no signs that New Delhi is going to give up its longstanding defense collaboration with Russia. Speaking to Sputnik, Indian analysts emphasized the country's ""strategic autonomy"" as New Delhi's major priority and presumed that the US's apparent plan to bring India into NATO’s fold would fail.<br><br>Having granted India a waiver under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), Washington made it clear that it wanted New Delhi to ""reduce inventory of Russian-produced major defense equipment and advanced conventional weapons."" However, India appears to be determined to continue defense cooperation with Moscow. Thus, Russia has tossed its hat into the ring of India's tender for the supply of 111 light multipurpose naval utility helicopters (NUH) and is currently taking part in New Delhi's Project 75I tendering procedure that envisages the procurement of six conventional submarines. It seems that the US might not be happy with the bolstering of Russo-Indian military collaboration.<br><br>Meanwhile, Russia's Sukhoi Su-57 fifth generation stealth multi-role fighter was publicly demonstrated at the latest Army 2018 International Military Technical Forum. Two of these warplanes will be soon delivered to the armed forces. All in all, the Russian Aerospace Forces will get 15 Su-57 fighters in the near future. Still, the designers will continue developing the aircraft. It is expected that the jet will have enhanced artificial intelligence capabilities.<br>Russia and India have jointly developed the new stealth fighter, previously known as the T-50 or PAK-FA, under the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft program (FGFA) for about 10 years. Reportedly, the Indian Air Force was not quite satisfied with the initial version of the plane's engine. However, the latest trials of Russia's cutting-edge Saturn ""izdeliye 30"" engines, which boost the Su-57's maneuverability and provide it with supersonic speed, have indicated that Russian designers are working against the clock to keep the aircraft up to date and on par with foreign analogues. Meanwhile, India's own fifth-generation fighter is reportedly expected to make its maiden flight in 2032.<br><br>Amrita Dhillon, a foreign affairs analyst and founding editor of New Delhi-based Kootneeti magazine, and retired Maj. Gen. Rajiv Narayanan, shared their views with Sputnik on the issue of Russo-Indian defense cooperation.<br><br><br>Sputnik: What was behind supposed frictions between India and Russia over the joint fifth-generation stealth fighter project? What about India's own fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA)?<br><br>Maj Gen Narayanan: There were a few issues that India was concerned with: a) a lack of sharing technology and security codes that would have ensured continued dependency on Russia — something that went against the grain of ""Make in India""; b) there were doubts over the levels of stealth it would provide and over the competitiveness [of the Su-57] among stealth aircraft in service of other nations because of production delays; c) the issue of engines and the need for their servicing in Russia at very short intervals was also problem.<br><br>The AMCA is a work in progress as a multi-modal project that is looking at public, private and joint-venture (JV) modes to fast-track its development.<br><br><br>Sputnik: What do you think about Russia's chances of winning the ongoing Project 75-India tender on six diesel-electric submarines in India? What do you know about the tender? Indian military blog India Defense Research Wing has suggested that the US may throw sand into the gears of a potential Russo-Indian deal. What's your take on that?<br><br>Maj Gen Narayanan: The Project 75-India is the follow-on project to the Project 75 Kalvari Class submarines (based on the French Scorpene Class submarines). These submarines would have advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. India intends to make all six submarines under this project in Indian dockyards.<br><br>There are only four countries in the fray: France, Germany, Spain and Russia. As the Indian Navy has the necessary expertise in using and sustaining Russian submarines, and now the French submarines, it would be difficult to say which way the deal swings. Indian Armed forces now use the ""life-cycle"" costs approach to make the best deal. As such it all depends on who meets the technical and commercial requirements of the Indian Navy.<br><br>India follows the concept of ""strategic autonomy"" and keeps in mind its strategic and core interests. To ascribe the capability of the US to dictate on India's core interests would be grossly incorrect. India also looks at Russia as its essential strategic partner. The waiver for procurement of S-400 systems from Russia is a case in point. The Project 75-India would go to the country that best meets the needs of the Indian Navy.<br><br><br>Sputnik: The Trump administration has recently granted Strategic Trade Authorization-1 status to India. India has become the third Asian nation to receive this status from the US after Japan and South Korea. What does this development mean for India? Is the US trying to bring New Delhi into NATO's fold, in your opinion?<br><br>Amrita Dhillon: India appears to be a big beneficiary of STA-1. It will boost the countries' cooperation in the areas of civil space, defense and other high technology sectors. However, in my view, the Trump administration's decision to put India in STA-1 from STA-2 is more business oriented. It is designed to remove the Congress and Senate limitations of conducting defense trade with India and makeover the failed Lockheed Martin deal over Rafale.<br><br>Another reason in my view is the mid-term elections, which will be held in November. Being the largest defense market, India will be an outstanding force in driving jobs in the US (something on what the Trump administration is focused). This also indicates clearly that India has all the qualities to fit in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), where China is blocking its entry.<br><br>Being a non-NATO country, India will follow its national interests. This is a little known fact that the Indian Navy is the only warfare service branch in the world which integrates American sensors with Soviet era technology. So, going into the NATO fold will never be an option for India by any means.</p>",From Su-57 to Project 75I: Why India Views Russia as Essential Strategic Partner
,"<p>Security forces are gearing up to launch an all-out war against Maoists in Malkangiri after the state government has made the newly constructed Gurupriya bridge functional.<br><br>“The rebels had turned this area into their stronghold, taking advantage of its inaccessibility. However, with construction of the bridge, the people inhabiting the 151 villages in this belt lying beyond the Balimela reservoir have been connected with the mainland. The bridge also gives us a distinct advantage in our war against the rebels. We are going to launch a decisive operation shortly,” said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity.<br><br>The 910-metre-long bridge had been planned in 1986 but could not be completed because of the reluctance of contractors, who feared Maoist attacks. After several failed attempts, the Rs 187.25-crore project had taken off in 2014 with two platoons of BSF standing guard at the site round the clock. Inaugurating the bridge on July 26, chief minister Naveen Patnaik called upon the rebels to give up violence and join the mainstream. “Violence is not the solution to anything. Peace is important for development,” he had said.<br><br>The region has been a Maoist stronghold since long. The rebels had ambushed and gunned down 32 elite Greyhound commandos of Andhra Pradesh police and a police constable in the Balimela reservoir while the jawans were returning from a combing operation in the “cut-off” area. The area had gained further notoriety in February 2011 when the Maoists abducted the then Malkangiri collector, R. Vineel Krishna, from the area.<br><br>Last year, the rebels had shot a boatman dead at the spillway ghat at Chitrakonda suspecting him to be a police informer.

Huge flames immediately leapt in the air as fire spread to several barracks reducing the structures to ashes. <br><br>Police said around 16 barracks, mostly made of wood,  were reduced to ashes within hours. <br><br>“A fire incident took place in Machil sector at 2 pm today. The fire was brought under control. Some damage to property took place. However, there is no loss of life. Cause of fire is being ascertained”, said Colonel Rajesh Kalia, defence spokesman at Srinagar.<br><br>The camp is located at a strategic location given that Machil is one of the routes for infiltration from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. Three militants were killed when army foiled an infiltration bid in Machil sector on June 6. Two of the three militants killed in Machil sector later turned out to be Kashmiris who had traveled to Pakistan on valid travel documents. <br><br>The army is trying to ascertain the losses caused by the fire. ""We are assessing the losses caused by the fire. Process has started to figure out the damages caused by the fire"", said an officer. <br><br>The police said the fire has mostly probably been caused either by the shot circuit or the Kerosene stove. ""Since there were wooden structures in the camp the fire spread quickly. Around 20 structures were damaged including four of the Power Development Department. <br><br>There is no loss of life. It seems the fire was most probably caused either by shot circuit or Kerosene stove”, said Ambarkar Shriram Dinkar, Senior Superintendent of Police, Kupwara.<br><br>Police said situation has been brought under control and only the wooden structures have been damaged. “Everything has been brought under control.

,"<p>The port town of Trincomalee in Eastern Sri Lanka is known for its scenic beauty eminently  qualified to be featured in the National Geographic Channel.<br><br>But historically, it has been noted for something very different – its strategic value as a naval base.<br><br>Trincomalee’s  military value had been grasped by world powers from the time of the Portuguese in the 17 th.Century. The Dutch, British, French, Indians, Americans, and the Japanese have eyed it in succession.<br><br>As on date, India, US and Japan are making a beeline to Trincomalee  and trying to convince the Sri Lankan government to accept their presence in Sri Lanka’s interest,” citing a potential maritime security threat to it from expansionist China. This stems from the worry that China could threaten the present free and rule-based international maritime commerce in the Indo-Pacific region.”<br><br>In August , Trincomalee saw the USS Anchorage of the US Seventh Fleet with Marines on board drop anchor there to hold humanitarian” exercises with the Sri Lankan navy. Coinciding with the first ever visit by a Japanese Defense Minister to Sri Lanka (including Trincomalee), the Japanese sent a destroyer Ikazuchi  to berth there.<br><br>Asked why this is happening now, Sri Lanka’s leading maritime security expert, Adm.Dr.Jayanatha Colombage, said that with the Chinese exclusively ensconced in Hambantota port with a 70% stake and a 99 year lease on it, and having a container terminal at Colombo port also,  the only port of value still available in Sri Lanka is Trincomalee.<br><br><br>Trinco Port’s Advantages ::<br><br>Trincomalee port has many advantages, Adm. Colombage said. It has been universally recognized as one of the finest harbors in the world”. It was Admiral Nelson who said that for the first time in 1775 when he sailed into it from Madras as a young midshipman on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS Seahorse. Nelson was so enamored of Trincomalee that he named his last frigate Trincomalee.<br><br>Trincomalee port has a natural depth of 25 meters and does not have to be dredged. This is a huge advantage in comparison with Hambantota and Colombo ports,” Colombage said.<br><br>According to independent marine researcher, Howard Martenstyn, Trincomalee harbor with 2000 hectares, is ten times larger than Colombo harbor. During World War II, Trincomalee protected the British Seventh Fleet. This proved invaluable after the British lost their principal Asian naval base at Singapore in 1942.<br><br><br>Ideal for nuclear submarines ::<br><br>Trincomalee has immense significance in this age of nuclear weaponry and nuclear submarine-based missile systems also,  points out  Romesh Somasundaram, who has written on the strategic value of Trincomalee.  Given the depth of the harbor, nuclear submarines are able to dive low within the inner harbor,” he says.<br><br>Furthermore, Trincomalee has been functioning as naval base since colonial times. According to Martenstyn,  in the 18 th. Century, the British believed that from Trincomalee a strong naval force could secure control of India’s Coromandel Coast (the Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh coastlines).<br><br>The Dutch had built a fort, and in the 20th. Century, the British built an airfield, a naval base, a naval dockyard  and also a huge oil storage facility with 101 giant oil tanks to supply both peacetime and wartime needs.<br><br>During World War II, the Japanese knew the role that Trincomalee was playing in the defense of British interests in Sri Lanka and the Bay of Bengal and bombarded it in 1942. Over 700 people were killed when carrier based Japanese aircraft struck in April 1942. Sri Lanka tasted its suicide attack when one of the Japanese bombers plunged into an oil tank setting it ablaze. The fire raged for a week melting the tank which had a one inch thick protective  steel wall.<br><br>Trincomalee is nearest to the countries on the shores of the  Bay of Bengal such as India (Southern and Eastern part of it),Bangladesh and Mynamar. Trincomalee commands the entrance to the Bay of Bengal which is now gaining economic and strategic importance with the entry of China as an economic power in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bangladesh, points out Adm.Colombage. Trincomalee rather than Hambantota is nearer  South East Asian ports ,he adds.<br><br>Somasundaram shows how a lot of Sri Lankan history revolved around control over Trincomalee. It was the Portuguese Admiral, Alfonso Albuquerque, who first saw the value of Trincomalee and made it part of his grand design of having bases in far flung areas to control the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean and protect Portugal’s maritime and imperial interests.<br><br>The Dutch took over Trincomalee from the Portuguese, beating the French to it though the latter had the sanction of the Kandyan King to possess Trincomalee. Subsequently, the British spent much time and energy seizing it from the Dutch.<br><br>In the 18th century, when the King of Kandy wanted to get rid of the oppressive Dutch, he sent word to the British in Madras  seeking help, and offering Trincomalee harbor as a bait.<br><br>Though the British wanted Trincomalee and sent emissary  John Pybus to the Kandyan court, they were reluctant to take on the Dutch because they were at peace with the Dutch in Europe at that time. This reticence led to bad relations between the Kandyan King and the British.<br><br>But by 1780, Britain itself was at war with Holland and also with the French. This time, every effort was made to seize Trincomalee from the Dutch.  When the British did seize Trincomalee, it became Britain’s first territorial possession in Sri Lanka.<br><br>Interestingly, Trincomalee was also the last place in the island they gave up. Although the British gave independence to Sri Lanka in 1948, they held on to the RAF base in Katunayake and the Royal Navy base in Trincomalee till 1957. The nationalist government of SWRD Bandaranaike had asked them to leave.<br><br><br>India Enters ::<br><br>By 1954, India was beginning to show an interest in Ceylon, albeit very tentatively. Somasundaram quotes an early Indian strategic thinker, R.R. Ramachandra Rao, as saying as early as in  1954, that India has very real interest in ensuring that no hostile power should establish itself in Ceylon (Sri Lanka)”.<br><br>More pointedly, Ramachandran Rao said: ” Foreign airstrips and naval control of Trincomalee would unbearably expose the Indian peninsula to air and sea bombardment and assault along her extensive coasts. Ceylon is within Indian defense area, at the very heart center of the Indian Ocean defense.”<br><br>In the 1980s, India feared encirclement by hostile forces. It had contradictions with China and the US, besides Pakistan. India feared that the pro-Western J.R. Jayewardene (JR) regime would soon make Sri Lanka a part of the anti-Indian Western alliance. India’s support for the minority Tamils in the island had alienated JR” from India.<br><br>To add to India’s fears, in 1985, JR  reminded British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that the Defense pact the British had signed with Sri Lanka in 1947 was still there, not having been abrogated formally.<br><br>These were among other reasons why India appended to the India-Sri Lanka accord of July 1987, an Exchange of Letters between President JR Jayewardene and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi which mentioned Trincomalee.<br><br>Through the letters, the two leaders agreed that: (1) Trincomalee or any other port of Sri Lanka, will not be made available for military use by any country in a manner prejudicial to India’s interests. (2) the work of restoring and operating the Trincomalee oil tank farm will be undertaken as a joint venture between India and Sri Lanka.<br><br>However, the tanks were handed over to India only in 2003 in exchange for supporting the Norwegian-brokered peace process in Sri Lanka to end the war with the separatist Tamil militants.<br><br>India has now been offered to chance to join Japan in developing the Trincomalee harbor and partner Singapore and Japan in developing the hinterland as an Economic Zone.</p>","Why are the US, Japan and India making a beeline for Trincomalee?"

,"<p>Countering Congress and Rahul Gandhi's charges against Narendra Modi government on Rafale deal, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today posed 15 questions to 'expose Congress party’s falsehood'. <br><br>Targeting Rahul Gandhi, Jaitley said it is expected from national political parties and its responsible leaders to keep themselves informed of the basic facts before they enter a public discourse on defence transactions. <br><br>""I am asking these questions as his misadventure is impairing national interest and I hope Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party would respond immediately,"" Arun Jaitley said in a blog on Facebook. <br><br>He said the Congress Party and its leader Rahul Gandhi are guilty on three counts: Firstly, the UPA delayed the deal by over a decade comprising national security. <br><br>""Secondly, every fact raised by Rahul Gandhi and the Congress are completely false and thirdly the party just wants to further delay the defence procurement so that India’s defence preparedness suffers,"" he added. <br><br>Hitting out at Rahul Gandhi, Jaitley said Gandhi revised his figures several times: ""Gandhi quoted a price of Rs 700 crore per aircraft in Delhi and Karnataka in April and May this year. In Parliament, he reduced it to Rs 520 crore per aircraft, in Raipur he increased it to Rs 540 crore.""<br><br>He said that the Congress Party’s false campaign on Rafale aircraft deal based on peddled untruth has been casting a cloud on the Inter-Governmental agreement and seriously compromising national security. <br><br><br>Here is the complete post written by Arun Jaitley on his facebook account:<br><br><br>Why these questions ?<br>Considering the security environment around India, the highest standards of defence preparedness are required. After the Kargil experience, the Armed Forces and the Raksha Mantralaya were of the opinion that combat ability of the Indian Air Force to strike at targets needs to be radically improved. This need was first recorded by the Raksha Mantralaya in the year 2001.<br><br>Considerations of the national security demanded that the IAF has the best available aircraft with the appropriate weaponry loaded on it. In principle approval for acceptance of necessity of procurement of 126 replacement aircrafts was recorded by the Raksha Mantri way back on 1st June, 2001. After the UPA Government came into power, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) approved the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for procurement of 126 medium multi-role combat aircrafts. An aircraft without weaponry is of little use in a war. It is only a flying instrument. It adds to the combat strength of the forces only when it is loaded with the requisite weaponry, which enables it to strike targets. The UPA Government issued a request for proposal on 28th August, 2007 and found two vendors, viz., M/s Dassault Aviation and M/s EADS to be compliant to the RFP requirements. It took the UPA five more years to commence the negotiations and in January, 2012 the Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC) determined Dassault Aviation to be L1.<br><br>For reasons best known to the UPA Government, on 27th June, 2012, the deal was directed to be re-examined, which effectively meant that the entire eleven-year exercise was abandoned and the process was to be undertaken afresh. India’s squadron strength was depleting because of age. This slow and casual approach of the UPA Government seriously compromised national security requirements.<br><br><br>The NDA approach ::<br><br>On 10th April, 2015, the Government of India and the French Government issued a joint statement where India decided to procure 36 Rafale aircrafts from the French Government on terms better than the ones conveyed by Dassault in the L1 bid of 2007. The same was approved by the DAC on 13th May, 2015 and finally the agreement, after a detailed procedure, was signed on 23rd September, 2016.<br><br><br>The false campaign ::<br><br>A false campaign based on untruth has been launched by the Congress Party casting a cloud on the Inter-Governmental agreement. The principal arguments of this campaign are the following:<br>(i) The NDA Government paid higher price than what the UPA would have paid if the deal would have completed on the basis of the 2007 offer of Dassault.<br>(ii) Proper procedures such as negotiations by the Contract Negotiation Committee and approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) were not obtained.<br>(iii) A private industrialist in India was favoured and the interest of public sector undertaking was compromised.<br><br>Each one of the above issues raised is based on complete falsehood. It is expected from national political parties and its responsible leaders to keep themselves informed of the basic facts before they enter a public discourse on defence transactions. The Congress Party and its leader, Shri Rahul Gandhi, are guilty on three counts:<br>(i) The UPA delayed the deal by over a decade and seriously compromised national security.<br>(ii) Every fact that Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party has spoken on pricing and procedure are completely false. <br>(iii) Its effort of raising these issues is to further delay a defence procurement so that India’s defence preparedness further suffers.<br><br><br>The questions --<br><br>I have, therefore, decided to ask the following questions to the Congress Party and its President. Needless to say that if replies are received in the public space or even if there is an issue diversion and no reply is received, I would be constrained to come out with further specific facts which establish truth as a victim of Shri Rahul Gandhi and his party merely peddling his falsehoods. Needless to say that I am constrained by the secrecy clause, which exists in the Contract and whatever I ask or respond to would be constrained by that limitation. My question to Shri Rahul Gandhi and his Party are as follows:<br><br><br>On Delay ::<br><br>(1) The UPA was a Government which suffered from a decision- making paralysis. Do you agree that the delay of over one decade was only on account of the incompetence and indecisiveness of the UPA Government?<br>(2) Did this delay seriously compromise national security? Is not the medium multi-role combat aircraft required by our forces to identify and strike at targets particularly when two of our neighbours have already enhanced their strength in this area?<br>(3) Was this delay and eventual abatement of the purchase by the UPA based on collateral considerations as had been witnessed in earlier transactions such as the purchase of the 155 mm Bofors gun?<br><br><br>Unsure of facts ::<br><br>(4) How is it that Shri Rahul Gandhi quoted a price of Rs.700 crores per aircraft in Delhi and Karnataka in April and May this year? In Parliament, he reduced it to Rs.520 crore per aircraft, in Raipur he increased it to Rs.540 crores; in Jaipur he used the two figures – Rs.520 crores and Rs.540 crores in the same speech. In Hyderabad, he invented a new price of Rs.526 crores. Truth has only one version, falsehood has many. Are these allegations being made without any familiarity with the facts of the Rafale purchase?<br>(5) Is Mr. Gandhi or the Congress Party aware of price comparison? Is Mr. Gandhi aware of the aircraft price, which was quoted in 2007 in the L1 bid? Is he aware that there was an escalation clause, which by 2015 when the NDA struck the price deal, would have further escalated the price? Would not the escalation clause have continued to escalate the price till each of the aircraft was supplied? Have the significant exchange rate variations between Rupee and Euro during the same period been considered?<br>(6) Is he aware of the fact that if the basic aircraft price on which UPA was to purchase the aircraft along with the escalation clause is compared at the price with the better terms on which the NDA Government signed the deal. The basic aircraft price itself is 9% cheaper under the NDA than it was under the UPA?<br>(7) Can Shri Rahul Gandhi deny that when the add-ons such as India-specific adaptations, weaponry, etc. are installed on the basic aircraft, the UPA price, which was mentioned in the 2007 L1 offer, would be at least 20% costlier than the more favourable price negotiated by the NDA?<br>(8) Can Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party deny if the total contract cost, that is, basic aircraft plus add-ons, including weaponry, etc., Indian adaptations plus future supplies and maintenance are all added, the NDA terms become far more favourable than the 2007 L1 offer?<br><br><br>Role of private industries ::<br><br>(9) Can Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress deny that the Government of India has no contract whatsoever with any private industry in relation with the Rafale aircraft supplies? In fact, 36 of the Rafale aircraft with their Indian adaptations are going to be sent to India and there is no manufacturing of these 36 aircrafts in India.<br>(10) Any Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) under the offset policy of the UPA can select any number of Indian partners, both from the private sector and the public sector, for offset supplies? This has nothing to do with the Government of India and, therefore, any private industry having benefitted from the Government of India is a complete lie. Can Shri Gandhi and his Party deny this?<br><br><br>On procedure :<br><br>(11) Are Shri Gandhi and his Party aware of the fact that there are two ways of acquiring a defence equipment, i.e., either by competitive bidding or by an Inter-Governmental Agreement?<br>(12) Can Mr. Gandhi and his Party deny that the UPA Government in 2007 itself had shortlisted the Rafale as technically- acceptable and L1 in price competition? <br>(13) Can Shri Gandhi and his Party deny that considering the urgency of the defence requirement, the Government of India and the French Government agreed to execute the supply of 36 Rafale aircrafts at terms better than the 2007 offer of the UPA?<br>(14) Can it be denied that both the Price Negotiation Committee and the Contract Negotiation Committee negotiated for 14 months before concluding the deal?<br>(15) Can it be denied that before the deal was executed, the Cabinet Committee on Security approved the transaction?<br>I am asking the above questions and I hope Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party would respond immediately.</p>",Arun Jaitley poses 15 questions to 'expose Congress party’s falsehood' on Rafale deal
