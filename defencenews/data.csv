Huge flames immediately leapt in the air as fire spread to several barracks reducing the structures to ashes. <br><br>Police said around 16 barracks, mostly made of wood,  were reduced to ashes within hours. <br><br>“A fire incident took place in Machil sector at 2 pm today. The fire was brought under control. Some damage to property took place. However, there is no loss of life. Cause of fire is being ascertained”, said Colonel Rajesh Kalia, defence spokesman at Srinagar.<br><br>The camp is located at a strategic location given that Machil is one of the routes for infiltration from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.

""We are assessing the losses caused by the fire. Process has started to figure out the damages caused by the fire"", said an officer. <br><br>The police said the fire has mostly probably been caused either by the shot circuit or the Kerosene stove. ""Since there were wooden structures in the camp the fire spread quickly. Around 20 structures were damaged including four of the Power Development Department. <br><br>There is no loss of life. It seems the fire was most probably caused either by shot circuit or Kerosene stove”, said Ambarkar Shriram Dinkar, Senior Superintendent of Police, Kupwara.<br><br>Police said situation has been brought under control and only the wooden structures have been damaged. “Everything has been brought under control.

,"<p>While the US is openly wooing India, there are no signs that New Delhi is going to give up its longstanding defense collaboration with Russia. Speaking to Sputnik, Indian analysts emphasized the country's ""strategic autonomy"" as New Delhi's major priority and presumed that the US's apparent plan to bring India into NATO’s fold would fail.<br><br>Having granted India a waiver under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), Washington made it clear that it wanted New Delhi to ""reduce inventory of Russian-produced major defense equipment and advanced conventional weapons."" However, India appears to be determined to continue defense cooperation with Moscow. Thus, Russia has tossed its hat into the ring of India's tender for the supply of 111 light multipurpose naval utility helicopters (NUH) and is currently taking part in New Delhi's Project 75I tendering procedure that envisages the procurement of six conventional submarines. It seems that the US might not be happy with the bolstering of Russo-Indian military collaboration.<br><br>Meanwhile, Russia's Sukhoi Su-57 fifth generation stealth multi-role fighter was publicly demonstrated at the latest Army 2018 International Military Technical Forum. Two of these warplanes will be soon delivered to the armed forces. All in all, the Russian Aerospace Forces will get 15 Su-57 fighters in the near future. Still, the designers will continue developing the aircraft. It is expected that the jet will have enhanced artificial intelligence capabilities.<br>Russia and India have jointly developed the new stealth fighter, previously known as the T-50 or PAK-FA, under the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft program (FGFA) for about 10 years. Reportedly, the Indian Air Force was not quite satisfied with the initial version of the plane's engine. However, the latest trials of Russia's cutting-edge Saturn ""izdeliye 30"" engines, which boost the Su-57's maneuverability and provide it with supersonic speed, have indicated that Russian designers are working against the clock to keep the aircraft up to date and on par with foreign analogues. Meanwhile, India's own fifth-generation fighter is reportedly expected to make its maiden flight in 2032.<br><br>Amrita Dhillon, a foreign affairs analyst and founding editor of New Delhi-based Kootneeti magazine, and retired Maj. Gen. Rajiv Narayanan, shared their views with Sputnik on the issue of Russo-Indian defense cooperation.<br><br><br>Sputnik: What was behind supposed frictions between India and Russia over the joint fifth-generation stealth fighter project? What about India's own fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA)?<br><br>Maj Gen Narayanan: There were a few issues that India was concerned with: a) a lack of sharing technology and security codes that would have ensured continued dependency on Russia — something that went against the grain of ""Make in India""; b) there were doubts over the levels of stealth it would provide and over the competitiveness [of the Su-57] among stealth aircraft in service of other nations because of production delays; c) the issue of engines and the need for their servicing in Russia at very short intervals was also problem.<br><br>The AMCA is a work in progress as a multi-modal project that is looking at public, private and joint-venture (JV) modes to fast-track its development.<br><br><br>Sputnik: What do you think about Russia's chances of winning the ongoing Project 75-India tender on six diesel-electric submarines in India? What do you know about the tender? Indian military blog India Defense Research Wing has suggested that the US may throw sand into the gears of a potential Russo-Indian deal. What's your take on that?<br><br>Maj Gen Narayanan: The Project 75-India is the follow-on project to the Project 75 Kalvari Class submarines (based on the French Scorpene Class submarines). These submarines would have advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. India intends to make all six submarines under this project in Indian dockyards.<br><br>There are only four countries in the fray: France, Germany, Spain and Russia. As the Indian Navy has the necessary expertise in using and sustaining Russian submarines, and now the French submarines, it would be difficult to say which way the deal swings. Indian Armed forces now use the ""life-cycle"" costs approach to make the best deal. As such it all depends on who meets the technical and commercial requirements of the Indian Navy.<br><br>India follows the concept of ""strategic autonomy"" and keeps in mind its strategic and core interests. To ascribe the capability of the US to dictate on India's core interests would be grossly incorrect. India also looks at Russia as its essential strategic partner. The waiver for procurement of S-400 systems from Russia is a case in point. The Project 75-India would go to the country that best meets the needs of the Indian Navy.<br><br><br>Sputnik: The Trump administration has recently granted Strategic Trade Authorization-1 status to India. India has become the third Asian nation to receive this status from the US after Japan and South Korea. What does this development mean for India? Is the US trying to bring New Delhi into NATO's fold, in your opinion?<br><br>Amrita Dhillon: India appears to be a big beneficiary of STA-1. It will boost the countries' cooperation in the areas of civil space, defense and other high technology sectors. However, in my view, the Trump administration's decision to put India in STA-1 from STA-2 is more business oriented. It is designed to remove the Congress and Senate limitations of conducting defense trade with India and makeover the failed Lockheed Martin deal over Rafale.<br><br>Another reason in my view is the mid-term elections, which will be held in November. Being the largest defense market, India will be an outstanding force in driving jobs in the US (something on what the Trump administration is focused). This also indicates clearly that India has all the qualities to fit in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), where China is blocking its entry.<br><br>Being a non-NATO country, India will follow its national interests. This is a little known fact that the Indian Navy is the only warfare service branch in the world which integrates American sensors with Soviet era technology. So, going into the NATO fold will never be an option for India by any means.</p>",From Su-57 to Project 75I: Why India Views Russia as Essential Strategic Partner

These radars enable jets to detect enemy targets from a standoff distance without getting exposed. They can also track and target multiple threats simultaneously, giving one jet the ability to take down several targets. An AESA radar will also be a defining parameter for the upcoming contest to supply 110 fighter jets to India under a Make in India scheme. <br><br>Israeli company ELTA is equipping 58 of the Indian Air Force Jaguar jets with AESA radars as part of the upgrade plan. No other Indian Air Force fighter had the AESA radar yet but India is processing a global tender for AESA radars for a new fleet of 83 LCA MK 1A fighters for which also ELTA has been down selected. <br><br>The integration of an AESA radar was a key parameter for the air force to clear the order for 83 LCA Mk 1A fighters, after years of blocking the indigenous fighter on concerns that it would not be combat worthy. </p>","DRDO wants to sell super radar technology for fighter jets to industry, invites applications"

Ayushman Bharat-National Health Protection Mission  (AB-NHPM), is the most ambitious scheme of the government until now which promises to give health cover of up to five lakhs to 10 crore poor families yearly.<br><br>The ministry for health and family welfare has signed an agreement with the skill development ministry for recruitment, following which around one lakh ‘Ayushman Mitras’ will be deployed at private and government hospitals under the scheme, the official said. It also likely create 10,000 jobs.  The government is in hurry to roll out the scheme as general elections are approaching.<br><br><br>3. 227 GW of renewable energy ::<br><br>India has kept a target of generating 227 GW of renewable energy by 2022. India had earlier kept a target of 175 GW earlier,  but after a slew of schemes were started the target has been revised.

But, before it could be formally inducted into the Air Force fleet, the ‘Eye in the Sky’ has flown into turbulence.<br><br>A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which was recently tabled in Parliament, has made startling observations about the programme, on which the Defence Research and Development Organisation has spent more than Rs 2,500 crore.<br><br>The CAG report showed irregularities in the selection of aircraft for the programme. The auditor slammed the DRDO for the cost overrun—the initial cost was Rs 1,800 crore—and its claims about indigenousness. Moreover, preferred vendors were selected to benefit certain companies, said the report. Though the Air Force had accepted the AEW&amp;CS last year, it is yet to get the final operational clearance.<br><br>The AEW&amp;CS is a moving surveillance platform, making it difficult for the enemy to locate the exact position of the aircraft. With its long range and detection capabilities, it gives a 360 degree view of the sky and can track many aircraft simultaneously.<br><br>China currently has 20 such airborne warning systems, while Pakistan has eight. The Indian Air Force has only three—Israeli Phalcon radar systems mounted on Russian IL-76 aircraft. India had bought the radar systems from Israel in 2004. According to experts, India currently does not have the capability to cover its entire airspace during a war.<br><br>A programme to develop an indigenous early warning system was taken up in 1994, but was shut down after a fatal crash. Subsequently, the defence ministry in 1999 approved the import of three airborne warning systems (the ones from Israel) and decided to meet further requirement through indigenous development.<br><br>In October 2004, the cabinet committee on security approved indigenous development of AEW&amp;CS at a cost of Rs 1,800 crore. The deadline was April 2011. Under the project, two AEW&amp;CS were to be supplied to the Air Force. DRDO’s Bengaluru-based laboratory, Centre for Air Borne Systems (CABS), was the nodal agency for design and development.<br><br>Considering the operational importance of this project, the CAG carried out an audit to know whether the system had everything that was promised. K. Subramaniam, principal director of audit, Air Force, recently sent the classified report to Dr S. Christopher, the then secretary of the Department of Defence Research and Development—which found serious irregularities in the programme.<br><br>The report has come down heavily on the programme over its claim of indigenousness. Despite the project being called home made, it was only 48 per cent indigenous. The DRDO had claimed it to be 81 per cent. And, the cost of foreign consultancy, about Rs 106 crore, was categorised as indigenous.<br><br>The CAG’s observations draw strength from the ongoing CBI investigation into alleged kickbacks in the process of selecting the aircraft. The Embraer EMB-145 aircraft from Brazil was shortlisted for the project in 2007. However, Brazilian media reported that Indian officials were bribed to swing the deal in Embraer’s favour. In 2016, the CBI registered a case against NRI arms dealer Vipin Khanna and two private companies based abroad. The case was about the alleged payment of more than $5.70 million as kickbacks to seal the deal for the aircraft.<br><br>The CAG report also pointed out inadequacies in management, which stretched the development period to 13 years. “And, the operational requirements, instead of being based on the functional needs of the Air Force, were being adjusted according to the aircraft that was ‘pre-selected’. It took seven years to finalise the operational requirements,” said the report.<br><br>During the design and development stage, some operational parameters were compromised because of the Embraer’s limitations. Also, there was no competitive bidding while selecting the aircraft. The Embraer was shortlisted through a nomination. Notably, several aircraft, such as the IL-76, and models from Gulfstream, Bombardier and Boeing were available at the time.<br><br>“The justification given for the selection of EMB-145 was not tenable,” the CAG observed. “No objective assessment of the merits and demerits of available options was done. The selection of EMB-145 was arbitrary and based on preconceived preference.”<br><br>Initial operational requirements stipulated that the system should be able to operate from high-altitude locations like Leh to have a much deeper view into the Chinese army’s activities. As the EMB-145 was incapable of doing so, claims the report, the Air Force had to drop this requirement in February 2006.<br><br>The report also said that the Air Force officials working with the DRDO reiterated that Embraer was not the suitable aircraft.<br><br>The CAG also criticised the project for the way the pilots were trained. “From the scrutiny of the expenditure on training, the audit found that the training commenced in June 2007. At this point, the procurement contract for EMB-145 was yet to be awarded and negotiations were underway between the CABS and M/s Embraer. Therefore, training of pilots on an aircraft even before finalising its purchase is highly unjustified,” CAG pointed out. Six pilots were trained abroad at a cost of Rs 23 crore.<br><br>Of the 18 requirements specified by the Air Force, AEW&amp;CS could not fully achieve ten important ones. Despite this, the Air Force accepted the first system in February 2017.<br><br>“Since EMB-145 was selected, the weight of the mission system had to be adjusted to the optimum payload capacity of EMB-145, which was 3,000kg. The radar along with its associated systems, which was to be mounted on the fuselage, had to be limited to 1,500 kilos due to structural limitations,” the CAG said.<br><br>The probable date of completion was revised four times and the final date of completion was extended by over six years, said the report. The Air Force kept changing its requirements. In the middle of the programme, the Air Force demanded air-to-air refuelling and a de-icing system. It led to a delay of nearly two years.<br><br>Christopher, who was the head of CABS, said the repeated modifications in the operational requirement by the Air Force played a major role in the delay of the project. “It is all recorded in official documents and no one can find fault with me for it,” he said. “However, I believe that operational requirements is a prerogative of the user and you, as a developer of the equipment, cannot challenge it.”<br><br>Regarding the aircraft, he said, “Embraer was a well-proven aircraft. The decision to buy Embraer was taken in consultation with the then IAF chief S. Krishnaswamy. Four countries were using this platform as AWACS—the generic term for such a system. Moreover, the IAF decided that it has to be a turbo jet, not propellant. Turbo engine gives them the desired speed and efficiency.”<br><br>When contacted, Krishnaswamy said the selection of aircraft was purely DRDO’s decision. “The IAF was using Embraer for its VVIP fleet and thought of commonality if it is selected for AEW&amp;CS. Since AEW&amp;CS was DRDO’s project and budget was allocated to them, the final decision for selecting aircraft was DRDO’s only,” he said, adding that any modification in the operational requirements was a collective decision of the Air Force and the DRDO. </p>",How a CAG report exposed DRDO's mishandling of AEW&CS programme

,"<p>Countering Congress and Rahul Gandhi's charges against Narendra Modi government on Rafale deal, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today posed 15 questions to 'expose Congress party’s falsehood'. <br><br>Targeting Rahul Gandhi, Jaitley said it is expected from national political parties and its responsible leaders to keep themselves informed of the basic facts before they enter a public discourse on defence transactions. <br><br>""I am asking these questions as his misadventure is impairing national interest and I hope Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party would respond immediately,"" Arun Jaitley said in a blog on Facebook. <br><br>He said the Congress Party and its leader Rahul Gandhi are guilty on three counts: Firstly, the UPA delayed the deal by over a decade comprising national security. <br><br>""Secondly, every fact raised by Rahul Gandhi and the Congress are completely false and thirdly the party just wants to further delay the defence procurement so that India’s defence preparedness suffers,"" he added. <br><br>Hitting out at Rahul Gandhi, Jaitley said Gandhi revised his figures several times: ""Gandhi quoted a price of Rs 700 crore per aircraft in Delhi and Karnataka in April and May this year. In Parliament, he reduced it to Rs 520 crore per aircraft, in Raipur he increased it to Rs 540 crore.""<br><br>He said that the Congress Party’s false campaign on Rafale aircraft deal based on peddled untruth has been casting a cloud on the Inter-Governmental agreement and seriously compromising national security. <br><br><br>Here is the complete post written by Arun Jaitley on his facebook account:<br><br><br>Why these questions ?<br>Considering the security environment around India, the highest standards of defence preparedness are required. After the Kargil experience, the Armed Forces and the Raksha Mantralaya were of the opinion that combat ability of the Indian Air Force to strike at targets needs to be radically improved. This need was first recorded by the Raksha Mantralaya in the year 2001.<br><br>Considerations of the national security demanded that the IAF has the best available aircraft with the appropriate weaponry loaded on it. In principle approval for acceptance of necessity of procurement of 126 replacement aircrafts was recorded by the Raksha Mantri way back on 1st June, 2001. After the UPA Government came into power, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) approved the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for procurement of 126 medium multi-role combat aircrafts. An aircraft without weaponry is of little use in a war. It is only a flying instrument. It adds to the combat strength of the forces only when it is loaded with the requisite weaponry, which enables it to strike targets. The UPA Government issued a request for proposal on 28th August, 2007 and found two vendors, viz., M/s Dassault Aviation and M/s EADS to be compliant to the RFP requirements. It took the UPA five more years to commence the negotiations and in January, 2012 the Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC) determined Dassault Aviation to be L1.<br><br>For reasons best known to the UPA Government, on 27th June, 2012, the deal was directed to be re-examined, which effectively meant that the entire eleven-year exercise was abandoned and the process was to be undertaken afresh. India’s squadron strength was depleting because of age. This slow and casual approach of the UPA Government seriously compromised national security requirements.<br><br><br>The NDA approach ::<br><br>On 10th April, 2015, the Government of India and the French Government issued a joint statement where India decided to procure 36 Rafale aircrafts from the French Government on terms better than the ones conveyed by Dassault in the L1 bid of 2007. The same was approved by the DAC on 13th May, 2015 and finally the agreement, after a detailed procedure, was signed on 23rd September, 2016.<br><br><br>The false campaign ::<br><br>A false campaign based on untruth has been launched by the Congress Party casting a cloud on the Inter-Governmental agreement. The principal arguments of this campaign are the following:<br>(i) The NDA Government paid higher price than what the UPA would have paid if the deal would have completed on the basis of the 2007 offer of Dassault.<br>(ii) Proper procedures such as negotiations by the Contract Negotiation Committee and approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) were not obtained.<br>(iii) A private industrialist in India was favoured and the interest of public sector undertaking was compromised.<br><br>Each one of the above issues raised is based on complete falsehood. It is expected from national political parties and its responsible leaders to keep themselves informed of the basic facts before they enter a public discourse on defence transactions. The Congress Party and its leader, Shri Rahul Gandhi, are guilty on three counts:<br>(i) The UPA delayed the deal by over a decade and seriously compromised national security.<br>(ii) Every fact that Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party has spoken on pricing and procedure are completely false. <br>(iii) Its effort of raising these issues is to further delay a defence procurement so that India’s defence preparedness further suffers.<br><br><br>The questions --<br><br>I have, therefore, decided to ask the following questions to the Congress Party and its President. Needless to say that if replies are received in the public space or even if there is an issue diversion and no reply is received, I would be constrained to come out with further specific facts which establish truth as a victim of Shri Rahul Gandhi and his party merely peddling his falsehoods. Needless to say that I am constrained by the secrecy clause, which exists in the Contract and whatever I ask or respond to would be constrained by that limitation. My question to Shri Rahul Gandhi and his Party are as follows:<br><br><br>On Delay ::<br><br>(1) The UPA was a Government which suffered from a decision- making paralysis. Do you agree that the delay of over one decade was only on account of the incompetence and indecisiveness of the UPA Government?<br>(2) Did this delay seriously compromise national security? Is not the medium multi-role combat aircraft required by our forces to identify and strike at targets particularly when two of our neighbours have already enhanced their strength in this area?<br>(3) Was this delay and eventual abatement of the purchase by the UPA based on collateral considerations as had been witnessed in earlier transactions such as the purchase of the 155 mm Bofors gun?<br><br><br>Unsure of facts ::<br><br>(4) How is it that Shri Rahul Gandhi quoted a price of Rs.700 crores per aircraft in Delhi and Karnataka in April and May this year? In Parliament, he reduced it to Rs.520 crore per aircraft, in Raipur he increased it to Rs.540 crores; in Jaipur he used the two figures – Rs.520 crores and Rs.540 crores in the same speech. In Hyderabad, he invented a new price of Rs.526 crores. Truth has only one version, falsehood has many. Are these allegations being made without any familiarity with the facts of the Rafale purchase?<br>(5) Is Mr. Gandhi or the Congress Party aware of price comparison? Is Mr. Gandhi aware of the aircraft price, which was quoted in 2007 in the L1 bid? Is he aware that there was an escalation clause, which by 2015 when the NDA struck the price deal, would have further escalated the price? Would not the escalation clause have continued to escalate the price till each of the aircraft was supplied? Have the significant exchange rate variations between Rupee and Euro during the same period been considered?<br>(6) Is he aware of the fact that if the basic aircraft price on which UPA was to purchase the aircraft along with the escalation clause is compared at the price with the better terms on which the NDA Government signed the deal. The basic aircraft price itself is 9% cheaper under the NDA than it was under the UPA?<br>(7) Can Shri Rahul Gandhi deny that when the add-ons such as India-specific adaptations, weaponry, etc. are installed on the basic aircraft, the UPA price, which was mentioned in the 2007 L1 offer, would be at least 20% costlier than the more favourable price negotiated by the NDA?<br>(8) Can Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party deny if the total contract cost, that is, basic aircraft plus add-ons, including weaponry, etc., Indian adaptations plus future supplies and maintenance are all added, the NDA terms become far more favourable than the 2007 L1 offer?<br><br><br>Role of private industries ::<br><br>(9) Can Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress deny that the Government of India has no contract whatsoever with any private industry in relation with the Rafale aircraft supplies? In fact, 36 of the Rafale aircraft with their Indian adaptations are going to be sent to India and there is no manufacturing of these 36 aircrafts in India.<br>(10) Any Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) under the offset policy of the UPA can select any number of Indian partners, both from the private sector and the public sector, for offset supplies? This has nothing to do with the Government of India and, therefore, any private industry having benefitted from the Government of India is a complete lie. Can Shri Gandhi and his Party deny this?<br><br><br>On procedure :<br><br>(11) Are Shri Gandhi and his Party aware of the fact that there are two ways of acquiring a defence equipment, i.e., either by competitive bidding or by an Inter-Governmental Agreement?<br>(12) Can Mr. Gandhi and his Party deny that the UPA Government in 2007 itself had shortlisted the Rafale as technically- acceptable and L1 in price competition? <br>(13) Can Shri Gandhi and his Party deny that considering the urgency of the defence requirement, the Government of India and the French Government agreed to execute the supply of 36 Rafale aircrafts at terms better than the 2007 offer of the UPA?<br>(14) Can it be denied that both the Price Negotiation Committee and the Contract Negotiation Committee negotiated for 14 months before concluding the deal?<br>(15) Can it be denied that before the deal was executed, the Cabinet Committee on Security approved the transaction?<br>I am asking the above questions and I hope Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party would respond immediately.</p>",Arun Jaitley poses 15 questions to 'expose Congress party’s falsehood' on Rafale deal
,"<p>The port town of Trincomalee in Eastern Sri Lanka is known for its scenic beauty eminently  qualified to be featured in the National Geographic Channel.<br><br>But historically, it has been noted for something very different – its strategic value as a naval base.<br><br>Trincomalee’s  military value had been grasped by world powers from the time of the Portuguese in the 17 th.Century. The Dutch, British, French, Indians, Americans, and the Japanese have eyed it in succession.<br><br>As on date, India, US and Japan are making a beeline to Trincomalee  and trying to convince the Sri Lankan government to accept their presence in Sri Lanka’s interest,” citing a potential maritime security threat to it from expansionist China. This stems from the worry that China could threaten the present free and rule-based international maritime commerce in the Indo-Pacific region.”<br><br>In August , Trincomalee saw the USS Anchorage of the US Seventh Fleet with Marines on board drop anchor there to hold humanitarian” exercises with the Sri Lankan navy. Coinciding with the first ever visit by a Japanese Defense Minister to Sri Lanka (including Trincomalee), the Japanese sent a destroyer Ikazuchi  to berth there.<br><br>Asked why this is happening now, Sri Lanka’s leading maritime security expert, Adm.Dr.Jayanatha Colombage, said that with the Chinese exclusively ensconced in Hambantota port with a 70% stake and a 99 year lease on it, and having a container terminal at Colombo port also,  the only port of value still available in Sri Lanka is Trincomalee.<br><br><br>Trinco Port’s Advantages ::<br><br>Trincomalee port has many advantages, Adm. Colombage said. It has been universally recognized as one of the finest harbors in the world”. It was Admiral Nelson who said that for the first time in 1775 when he sailed into it from Madras as a young midshipman on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS Seahorse. Nelson was so enamored of Trincomalee that he named his last frigate Trincomalee.<br><br>Trincomalee port has a natural depth of 25 meters and does not have to be dredged. This is a huge advantage in comparison with Hambantota and Colombo ports,” Colombage said.<br><br>According to independent marine researcher, Howard Martenstyn, Trincomalee harbor with 2000 hectares, is ten times larger than Colombo harbor. During World War II, Trincomalee protected the British Seventh Fleet. This proved invaluable after the British lost their principal Asian naval base at Singapore in 1942.<br><br><br>Ideal for nuclear submarines ::<br><br>Trincomalee has immense significance in this age of nuclear weaponry and nuclear submarine-based missile systems also,  points out  Romesh Somasundaram, who has written on the strategic value of Trincomalee.  Given the depth of the harbor, nuclear submarines are able to dive low within the inner harbor,” he says.<br><br>Furthermore, Trincomalee has been functioning as naval base since colonial times. According to Martenstyn,  in the 18 th. Century, the British believed that from Trincomalee a strong naval force could secure control of India’s Coromandel Coast (the Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh coastlines).<br><br>The Dutch had built a fort, and in the 20th. Century, the British built an airfield, a naval base, a naval dockyard  and also a huge oil storage facility with 101 giant oil tanks to supply both peacetime and wartime needs.<br><br>During World War II, the Japanese knew the role that Trincomalee was playing in the defense of British interests in Sri Lanka and the Bay of Bengal and bombarded it in 1942. Over 700 people were killed when carrier based Japanese aircraft struck in April 1942. Sri Lanka tasted its suicide attack when one of the Japanese bombers plunged into an oil tank setting it ablaze. The fire raged for a week melting the tank which had a one inch thick protective  steel wall.<br><br>Trincomalee is nearest to the countries on the shores of the  Bay of Bengal such as India (Southern and Eastern part of it),Bangladesh and Mynamar. Trincomalee commands the entrance to the Bay of Bengal which is now gaining economic and strategic importance with the entry of China as an economic power in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bangladesh, points out Adm.Colombage. Trincomalee rather than Hambantota is nearer  South East Asian ports ,he adds.<br><br>Somasundaram shows how a lot of Sri Lankan history revolved around control over Trincomalee. It was the Portuguese Admiral, Alfonso Albuquerque, who first saw the value of Trincomalee and made it part of his grand design of having bases in far flung areas to control the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean and protect Portugal’s maritime and imperial interests.<br><br>The Dutch took over Trincomalee from the Portuguese, beating the French to it though the latter had the sanction of the Kandyan King to possess Trincomalee. Subsequently, the British spent much time and energy seizing it from the Dutch.<br><br>In the 18th century, when the King of Kandy wanted to get rid of the oppressive Dutch, he sent word to the British in Madras  seeking help, and offering Trincomalee harbor as a bait.<br><br>Though the British wanted Trincomalee and sent emissary  John Pybus to the Kandyan court, they were reluctant to take on the Dutch because they were at peace with the Dutch in Europe at that time. This reticence led to bad relations between the Kandyan King and the British.<br><br>But by 1780, Britain itself was at war with Holland and also with the French. This time, every effort was made to seize Trincomalee from the Dutch.  When the British did seize Trincomalee, it became Britain’s first territorial possession in Sri Lanka.<br><br>Interestingly, Trincomalee was also the last place in the island they gave up. Although the British gave independence to Sri Lanka in 1948, they held on to the RAF base in Katunayake and the Royal Navy base in Trincomalee till 1957. The nationalist government of SWRD Bandaranaike had asked them to leave.<br><br><br>India Enters ::<br><br>By 1954, India was beginning to show an interest in Ceylon, albeit very tentatively. Somasundaram quotes an early Indian strategic thinker, R.R. Ramachandra Rao, as saying as early as in  1954, that India has very real interest in ensuring that no hostile power should establish itself in Ceylon (Sri Lanka)”.<br><br>More pointedly, Ramachandran Rao said: ” Foreign airstrips and naval control of Trincomalee would unbearably expose the Indian peninsula to air and sea bombardment and assault along her extensive coasts. Ceylon is within Indian defense area, at the very heart center of the Indian Ocean defense.”<br><br>In the 1980s, India feared encirclement by hostile forces. It had contradictions with China and the US, besides Pakistan. India feared that the pro-Western J.R. Jayewardene (JR) regime would soon make Sri Lanka a part of the anti-Indian Western alliance. India’s support for the minority Tamils in the island had alienated JR” from India.<br><br>To add to India’s fears, in 1985, JR  reminded British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that the Defense pact the British had signed with Sri Lanka in 1947 was still there, not having been abrogated formally.<br><br>These were among other reasons why India appended to the India-Sri Lanka accord of July 1987, an Exchange of Letters between President JR Jayewardene and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi which mentioned Trincomalee.<br><br>Through the letters, the two leaders agreed that: (1) Trincomalee or any other port of Sri Lanka, will not be made available for military use by any country in a manner prejudicial to India’s interests. (2) the work of restoring and operating the Trincomalee oil tank farm will be undertaken as a joint venture between India and Sri Lanka.<br><br>However, the tanks were handed over to India only in 2003 in exchange for supporting the Norwegian-brokered peace process in Sri Lanka to end the war with the separatist Tamil militants.<br><br>India has now been offered to chance to join Japan in developing the Trincomalee harbor and partner Singapore and Japan in developing the hinterland as an Economic Zone.</p>","Why are the US, Japan and India making a beeline for Trincomalee?"

,"<p>The port town of Trincomalee in Eastern Sri Lanka is known for its scenic beauty eminently  qualified to be featured in the National Geographic Channel.<br><br>But historically, it has been noted for something very different – its strategic value as a naval base.<br><br>Trincomalee’s  military value had been grasped by world powers from the time of the Portuguese in the 17 th.Century. The Dutch, British, French, Indians, Americans, and the Japanese have eyed it in succession.<br><br>As on date, India, US and Japan are making a beeline to Trincomalee  and trying to convince the Sri Lankan government to accept their presence in Sri Lanka’s interest,” citing a potential maritime security threat to it from expansionist China. This stems from the worry that China could threaten the present free and rule-based international maritime commerce in the Indo-Pacific region.”<br><br>In August , Trincomalee saw the USS Anchorage of the US Seventh Fleet with Marines on board drop anchor there to hold humanitarian” exercises with the Sri Lankan navy. Coinciding with the first ever visit by a Japanese Defense Minister to Sri Lanka (including Trincomalee), the Japanese sent a destroyer Ikazuchi  to berth there.<br><br>Asked why this is happening now, Sri Lanka’s leading maritime security expert, Adm.Dr.Jayanatha Colombage, said that with the Chinese exclusively ensconced in Hambantota port with a 70% stake and a 99 year lease on it, and having a container terminal at Colombo port also,  the only port of value still available in Sri Lanka is Trincomalee.<br><br><br>Trinco Port’s Advantages ::<br><br>Trincomalee port has many advantages, Adm. Colombage said. It has been universally recognized as one of the finest harbors in the world”. It was Admiral Nelson who said that for the first time in 1775 when he sailed into it from Madras as a young midshipman on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS Seahorse. Nelson was so enamored of Trincomalee that he named his last frigate Trincomalee.<br><br>Trincomalee port has a natural depth of 25 meters and does not have to be dredged. This is a huge advantage in comparison with Hambantota and Colombo ports,” Colombage said.<br><br>According to independent marine researcher, Howard Martenstyn, Trincomalee harbor with 2000 hectares, is ten times larger than Colombo harbor. During World War II, Trincomalee protected the British Seventh Fleet. This proved invaluable after the British lost their principal Asian naval base at Singapore in 1942.<br><br><br>Ideal for nuclear submarines ::<br><br>Trincomalee has immense significance in this age of nuclear weaponry and nuclear submarine-based missile systems also,  points out  Romesh Somasundaram, who has written on the strategic value of Trincomalee.  Given the depth of the harbor, nuclear submarines are able to dive low within the inner harbor,” he says.<br><br>Furthermore, Trincomalee has been functioning as naval base since colonial times. According to Martenstyn,  in the 18 th. Century, the British believed that from Trincomalee a strong naval force could secure control of India’s Coromandel Coast (the Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh coastlines).<br><br>The Dutch had built a fort, and in the 20th. Century, the British built an airfield, a naval base, a naval dockyard  and also a huge oil storage facility with 101 giant oil tanks to supply both peacetime and wartime needs.<br><br>During World War II, the Japanese knew the role that Trincomalee was playing in the defense of British interests in Sri Lanka and the Bay of Bengal and bombarded it in 1942. Over 700 people were killed when carrier based Japanese aircraft struck in April 1942. Sri Lanka tasted its suicide attack when one of the Japanese bombers plunged into an oil tank setting it ablaze. The fire raged for a week melting the tank which had a one inch thick protective  steel wall.<br><br>Trincomalee is nearest to the countries on the shores of the  Bay of Bengal such as India (Southern and Eastern part of it),Bangladesh and Mynamar. Trincomalee commands the entrance to the Bay of Bengal which is now gaining economic and strategic importance with the entry of China as an economic power in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bangladesh, points out Adm.Colombage. Trincomalee rather than Hambantota is nearer  South East Asian ports ,he adds.<br><br>Somasundaram shows how a lot of Sri Lankan history revolved around control over Trincomalee. It was the Portuguese Admiral, Alfonso Albuquerque, who first saw the value of Trincomalee and made it part of his grand design of having bases in far flung areas to control the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean and protect Portugal’s maritime and imperial interests.<br><br>The Dutch took over Trincomalee from the Portuguese, beating the French to it though the latter had the sanction of the Kandyan King to possess Trincomalee. Subsequently, the British spent much time and energy seizing it from the Dutch.<br><br>In the 18th century, when the King of Kandy wanted to get rid of the oppressive Dutch, he sent word to the British in Madras  seeking help, and offering Trincomalee harbor as a bait.<br><br>Though the British wanted Trincomalee and sent emissary  John Pybus to the Kandyan court, they were reluctant to take on the Dutch because they were at peace with the Dutch in Europe at that time. This reticence led to bad relations between the Kandyan King and the British.<br><br>But by 1780, Britain itself was at war with Holland and also with the French. This time, every effort was made to seize Trincomalee from the Dutch.  When the British did seize Trincomalee, it became Britain’s first territorial possession in Sri Lanka.<br><br>Interestingly, Trincomalee was also the last place in the island they gave up. Although the British gave independence to Sri Lanka in 1948, they held on to the RAF base in Katunayake and the Royal Navy base in Trincomalee till 1957. The nationalist government of SWRD Bandaranaike had asked them to leave.<br><br><br>India Enters ::<br><br>By 1954, India was beginning to show an interest in Ceylon, albeit very tentatively. Somasundaram quotes an early Indian strategic thinker, R.R. Ramachandra Rao, as saying as early as in  1954, that India has very real interest in ensuring that no hostile power should establish itself in Ceylon (Sri Lanka)”.<br><br>More pointedly, Ramachandran Rao said: ” Foreign airstrips and naval control of Trincomalee would unbearably expose the Indian peninsula to air and sea bombardment and assault along her extensive coasts. Ceylon is within Indian defense area, at the very heart center of the Indian Ocean defense.”<br><br>In the 1980s, India feared encirclement by hostile forces. It had contradictions with China and the US, besides Pakistan. India feared that the pro-Western J.R. Jayewardene (JR) regime would soon make Sri Lanka a part of the anti-Indian Western alliance. India’s support for the minority Tamils in the island had alienated JR” from India.<br><br>To add to India’s fears, in 1985, JR  reminded British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that the Defense pact the British had signed with Sri Lanka in 1947 was still there, not having been abrogated formally.<br><br>These were among other reasons why India appended to the India-Sri Lanka accord of July 1987, an Exchange of Letters between President JR Jayewardene and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi which mentioned Trincomalee.<br><br>Through the letters, the two leaders agreed that: (1) Trincomalee or any other port of Sri Lanka, will not be made available for military use by any country in a manner prejudicial to India’s interests. (2) the work of restoring and operating the Trincomalee oil tank farm will be undertaken as a joint venture between India and Sri Lanka.<br><br>However, the tanks were handed over to India only in 2003 in exchange for supporting the Norwegian-brokered peace process in Sri Lanka to end the war with the separatist Tamil militants.<br><br>India has now been offered to chance to join Japan in developing the Trincomalee harbor and partner Singapore and Japan in developing the hinterland as an Economic Zone.</p>","Why are the US, Japan and India making a beeline for Trincomalee?"

K. Subramaniam, principal director of audit, Air Force, recently sent the classified report to Dr S. Christopher, the then secretary of the Department of Defence Research and Development—which found serious irregularities in the programme.<br><br>The report has come down heavily on the programme over its claim of indigenousness. Despite the project being called home made, it was only 48 per cent indigenous. The DRDO had claimed it to be 81 per cent. And, the cost of foreign consultancy, about Rs 106 crore, was categorised as indigenous.<br><br>The CAG’s observations draw strength from the ongoing CBI investigation into alleged kickbacks in the process of selecting the aircraft. The Embraer EMB-145 aircraft from Brazil was shortlisted for the project in 2007. However, Brazilian media reported that Indian officials were bribed to swing the deal in Embraer’s favour. In 2016, the CBI registered a case against NRI arms dealer Vipin Khanna and two private companies based abroad. The case was about the alleged payment of more than $5.70 million as kickbacks to seal the deal for the aircraft.<br><br>The CAG report also pointed out inadequacies in management, which stretched the development period to 13 years. “And, the operational requirements, instead of being based on the functional needs of the Air Force, were being adjusted according to the aircraft that was ‘pre-selected’. It took seven years to finalise the operational requirements,” said the report.<br><br>During the design and development stage, some operational parameters were compromised because of the Embraer’s limitations. Also, there was no competitive bidding while selecting the aircraft. The Embraer was shortlisted through a nomination. Notably, several aircraft, such as the IL-76, and models from Gulfstream, Bombardier and Boeing were available at the time.<br><br>“The justification given for the selection of EMB-145 was not tenable,” the CAG observed. “No objective assessment of the merits and demerits of available options was done. The selection of EMB-145 was arbitrary and based on preconceived preference.”<br><br>Initial operational requirements stipulated that the system should be able to operate from high-altitude locations like Leh to have a much deeper view into the Chinese army’s activities. As the EMB-145 was incapable of doing so, claims the report, the Air Force had to drop this requirement in February 2006.<br><br>The report also said that the Air Force officials working with the DRDO reiterated that Embraer was not the suitable aircraft.<br><br>The CAG also criticised the project for the way the pilots were trained. “From the scrutiny of the expenditure on training, the audit found that the training commenced in June 2007. At this point, the procurement contract for EMB-145 was yet to be awarded and negotiations were underway between the CABS and M/s Embraer. Therefore, training of pilots on an aircraft even before finalising its purchase is highly unjustified,” CAG pointed out. Six pilots were trained abroad at a cost of Rs 23 crore.<br><br>Of the 18 requirements specified by the Air Force, AEW&amp;CS could not fully achieve ten important ones. Despite this, the Air Force accepted the first system in February 2017.<br><br>“Since EMB-145 was selected, the weight of the mission system had to be adjusted to the optimum payload capacity of EMB-145, which was 3,000kg. The radar along with its associated systems, which was to be mounted on the fuselage, had to be limited to 1,500 kilos due to structural limitations,” the CAG said.<br><br>The probable date of completion was revised four times and the final date of completion was extended by over six years, said the report. The Air Force kept changing its requirements. In the middle of the programme, the Air Force demanded air-to-air refuelling and a de-icing system. It led to a delay of nearly two years.<br><br>Christopher, who was the head of CABS, said the repeated modifications in the operational requirement by the Air Force played a major role in the delay of the project. “It is all recorded in official documents and no one can find fault with me for it,” he said. “However, I believe that operational requirements is a prerogative of the user and you, as a developer of the equipment, cannot challenge it.”<br><br>Regarding the aircraft, he said, “Embraer was a well-proven aircraft. The decision to buy Embraer was taken in consultation with the then IAF chief S. Krishnaswamy. Four countries were using this platform as AWACS—the generic term for such a system. Moreover, the IAF decided that it has to be a turbo jet, not propellant. Turbo engine gives them the desired speed and efficiency.”<br><br>When contacted, Krishnaswamy said the selection of aircraft was purely DRDO’s decision. “The IAF was using Embraer for its VVIP fleet and thought of commonality if it is selected for AEW&amp;CS. Since AEW&amp;CS was DRDO’s project and budget was allocated to them, the final decision for selecting aircraft was DRDO’s only,” he said, adding that any modification in the operational requirements was a collective decision of the Air Force and the DRDO. </p>",How a CAG report exposed DRDO's mishandling of AEW&CS programme

However, India appears to be determined to continue defense cooperation with Moscow. Thus, Russia has tossed its hat into the ring of India's tender for the supply of 111 light multipurpose naval utility helicopters (NUH) and is currently taking part in New Delhi's Project 75I tendering procedure that envisages the procurement of six conventional submarines.

However, the latest trials of Russia's cutting-edge Saturn ""izdeliye 30"" engines, which boost the Su-57's maneuverability and provide it with supersonic speed, have indicated that Russian designers are working against the clock to keep the aircraft up to date and on par with foreign analogues.

What about India's own fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA)?<br><br>Maj Gen Narayanan: There were a few issues that India was concerned with: a) a lack of sharing technology and security codes that would have ensured continued dependency on Russia — something that went against the grain of ""Make in India""; b) there were doubts over the levels of stealth it would provide and over the competitiveness [of the Su-57] among stealth aircraft in service of other nations because of production delays; c) the issue of engines and the need for their servicing in Russia at very short intervals was also problem.<br><br>The AMCA is a work in progress as a multi-modal project that is looking at public, private and joint-venture (JV) modes to fast-track its development.<br><br><br>Sputnik: What do you think about Russia's chances of winning the ongoing Project 75-India tender on six diesel-electric submarines in India?

What's your take on that?<br><br>Maj Gen Narayanan: The Project 75-India is the follow-on project to the Project 75 Kalvari Class submarines (based on the French Scorpene Class submarines). These submarines would have advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. India intends to make all six submarines under this project in Indian dockyards.<br><br>There are only four countries in the fray: France, Germany, Spain and Russia. As the Indian Navy has the necessary expertise in using and sustaining Russian submarines, and now the French submarines, it would be difficult to say which way the deal swings.

As such it all depends on who meets the technical and commercial requirements of the Indian Navy.<br><br>India follows the concept of ""strategic autonomy"" and keeps in mind its strategic and core interests. To ascribe the capability of the US to dictate on India's core interests would be grossly incorrect. India also looks at Russia as its essential strategic partner.

It will boost the countries' cooperation in the areas of civil space, defense and other high technology sectors. However, in my view, the Trump administration's decision to put India in STA-1 from STA-2 is more business oriented. It is designed to remove the Congress and Senate limitations of conducting defense trade with India and makeover the failed Lockheed Martin deal over Rafale.<br><br>Another reason in my view is the mid-term elections, which will be held in November. Being the largest defense market, India will be an outstanding force in driving jobs in the US (something on what the Trump administration is focused).

,"<p>Countering Congress and Rahul Gandhi's charges against Narendra Modi government on Rafale deal, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today posed 15 questions to 'expose Congress party’s falsehood'. <br><br>Targeting Rahul Gandhi, Jaitley said it is expected from national political parties and its responsible leaders to keep themselves informed of the basic facts before they enter a public discourse on defence transactions. <br><br>""I am asking these questions as his misadventure is impairing national interest and I hope Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party would respond immediately,"" Arun Jaitley said in a blog on Facebook. <br><br>He said the Congress Party and its leader Rahul Gandhi are guilty on three counts: Firstly, the UPA delayed the deal by over a decade comprising national security. <br><br>""Secondly, every fact raised by Rahul Gandhi and the Congress are completely false and thirdly the party just wants to further delay the defence procurement so that India’s defence preparedness suffers,"" he added. <br><br>Hitting out at Rahul Gandhi, Jaitley said Gandhi revised his figures several times: ""Gandhi quoted a price of Rs 700 crore per aircraft in Delhi and Karnataka in April and May this year. In Parliament, he reduced it to Rs 520 crore per aircraft, in Raipur he increased it to Rs 540 crore.""<br><br>He said that the Congress Party’s false campaign on Rafale aircraft deal based on peddled untruth has been casting a cloud on the Inter-Governmental agreement and seriously compromising national security. <br><br><br>Here is the complete post written by Arun Jaitley on his facebook account:<br><br><br>Why these questions ?<br>Considering the security environment around India, the highest standards of defence preparedness are required. After the Kargil experience, the Armed Forces and the Raksha Mantralaya were of the opinion that combat ability of the Indian Air Force to strike at targets needs to be radically improved. This need was first recorded by the Raksha Mantralaya in the year 2001.<br><br>Considerations of the national security demanded that the IAF has the best available aircraft with the appropriate weaponry loaded on it. In principle approval for acceptance of necessity of procurement of 126 replacement aircrafts was recorded by the Raksha Mantri way back on 1st June, 2001. After the UPA Government came into power, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) approved the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for procurement of 126 medium multi-role combat aircrafts. An aircraft without weaponry is of little use in a war. It is only a flying instrument. It adds to the combat strength of the forces only when it is loaded with the requisite weaponry, which enables it to strike targets. The UPA Government issued a request for proposal on 28th August, 2007 and found two vendors, viz., M/s Dassault Aviation and M/s EADS to be compliant to the RFP requirements. It took the UPA five more years to commence the negotiations and in January, 2012 the Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC) determined Dassault Aviation to be L1.<br><br>For reasons best known to the UPA Government, on 27th June, 2012, the deal was directed to be re-examined, which effectively meant that the entire eleven-year exercise was abandoned and the process was to be undertaken afresh. India’s squadron strength was depleting because of age. This slow and casual approach of the UPA Government seriously compromised national security requirements.<br><br><br>The NDA approach ::<br><br>On 10th April, 2015, the Government of India and the French Government issued a joint statement where India decided to procure 36 Rafale aircrafts from the French Government on terms better than the ones conveyed by Dassault in the L1 bid of 2007. The same was approved by the DAC on 13th May, 2015 and finally the agreement, after a detailed procedure, was signed on 23rd September, 2016.<br><br><br>The false campaign ::<br><br>A false campaign based on untruth has been launched by the Congress Party casting a cloud on the Inter-Governmental agreement. The principal arguments of this campaign are the following:<br>(i) The NDA Government paid higher price than what the UPA would have paid if the deal would have completed on the basis of the 2007 offer of Dassault.<br>(ii) Proper procedures such as negotiations by the Contract Negotiation Committee and approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) were not obtained.<br>(iii) A private industrialist in India was favoured and the interest of public sector undertaking was compromised.<br><br>Each one of the above issues raised is based on complete falsehood. It is expected from national political parties and its responsible leaders to keep themselves informed of the basic facts before they enter a public discourse on defence transactions. The Congress Party and its leader, Shri Rahul Gandhi, are guilty on three counts:<br>(i) The UPA delayed the deal by over a decade and seriously compromised national security.<br>(ii) Every fact that Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party has spoken on pricing and procedure are completely false. <br>(iii) Its effort of raising these issues is to further delay a defence procurement so that India’s defence preparedness further suffers.<br><br><br>The questions --<br><br>I have, therefore, decided to ask the following questions to the Congress Party and its President. Needless to say that if replies are received in the public space or even if there is an issue diversion and no reply is received, I would be constrained to come out with further specific facts which establish truth as a victim of Shri Rahul Gandhi and his party merely peddling his falsehoods. Needless to say that I am constrained by the secrecy clause, which exists in the Contract and whatever I ask or respond to would be constrained by that limitation. My question to Shri Rahul Gandhi and his Party are as follows:<br><br><br>On Delay ::<br><br>(1) The UPA was a Government which suffered from a decision- making paralysis. Do you agree that the delay of over one decade was only on account of the incompetence and indecisiveness of the UPA Government?<br>(2) Did this delay seriously compromise national security? Is not the medium multi-role combat aircraft required by our forces to identify and strike at targets particularly when two of our neighbours have already enhanced their strength in this area?<br>(3) Was this delay and eventual abatement of the purchase by the UPA based on collateral considerations as had been witnessed in earlier transactions such as the purchase of the 155 mm Bofors gun?<br><br><br>Unsure of facts ::<br><br>(4) How is it that Shri Rahul Gandhi quoted a price of Rs.700 crores per aircraft in Delhi and Karnataka in April and May this year? In Parliament, he reduced it to Rs.520 crore per aircraft, in Raipur he increased it to Rs.540 crores; in Jaipur he used the two figures – Rs.520 crores and Rs.540 crores in the same speech. In Hyderabad, he invented a new price of Rs.526 crores. Truth has only one version, falsehood has many. Are these allegations being made without any familiarity with the facts of the Rafale purchase?<br>(5) Is Mr. Gandhi or the Congress Party aware of price comparison? Is Mr. Gandhi aware of the aircraft price, which was quoted in 2007 in the L1 bid? Is he aware that there was an escalation clause, which by 2015 when the NDA struck the price deal, would have further escalated the price? Would not the escalation clause have continued to escalate the price till each of the aircraft was supplied? Have the significant exchange rate variations between Rupee and Euro during the same period been considered?<br>(6) Is he aware of the fact that if the basic aircraft price on which UPA was to purchase the aircraft along with the escalation clause is compared at the price with the better terms on which the NDA Government signed the deal. The basic aircraft price itself is 9% cheaper under the NDA than it was under the UPA?<br>(7) Can Shri Rahul Gandhi deny that when the add-ons such as India-specific adaptations, weaponry, etc. are installed on the basic aircraft, the UPA price, which was mentioned in the 2007 L1 offer, would be at least 20% costlier than the more favourable price negotiated by the NDA?<br>(8) Can Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party deny if the total contract cost, that is, basic aircraft plus add-ons, including weaponry, etc., Indian adaptations plus future supplies and maintenance are all added, the NDA terms become far more favourable than the 2007 L1 offer?<br><br><br>Role of private industries ::<br><br>(9) Can Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress deny that the Government of India has no contract whatsoever with any private industry in relation with the Rafale aircraft supplies? In fact, 36 of the Rafale aircraft with their Indian adaptations are going to be sent to India and there is no manufacturing of these 36 aircrafts in India.<br>(10) Any Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) under the offset policy of the UPA can select any number of Indian partners, both from the private sector and the public sector, for offset supplies? This has nothing to do with the Government of India and, therefore, any private industry having benefitted from the Government of India is a complete lie. Can Shri Gandhi and his Party deny this?<br><br><br>On procedure :<br><br>(11) Are Shri Gandhi and his Party aware of the fact that there are two ways of acquiring a defence equipment, i.e., either by competitive bidding or by an Inter-Governmental Agreement?<br>(12) Can Mr. Gandhi and his Party deny that the UPA Government in 2007 itself had shortlisted the Rafale as technically- acceptable and L1 in price competition? <br>(13) Can Shri Gandhi and his Party deny that considering the urgency of the defence requirement, the Government of India and the French Government agreed to execute the supply of 36 Rafale aircrafts at terms better than the 2007 offer of the UPA?<br>(14) Can it be denied that both the Price Negotiation Committee and the Contract Negotiation Committee negotiated for 14 months before concluding the deal?<br>(15) Can it be denied that before the deal was executed, the Cabinet Committee on Security approved the transaction?<br>I am asking the above questions and I hope Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party would respond immediately.</p>",Arun Jaitley poses 15 questions to 'expose Congress party’s falsehood' on Rafale deal
